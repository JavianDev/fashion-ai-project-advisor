Dressing for Height:
  - Tall Individuals: Can carry off longer hemlines, oversized styles, and bold patterns. Vertical stripes can make you appear even taller, while horizontal stripes can add width.
  - Petite Individuals: Opt for well-fitted clothing, vertical lines, and monochromatic looks to create an elongated silhouette. Avoid overly baggy clothes or very long hemlines that can overwhelm your frame.

Dressing for Weight/Build:
  - Slim Build: Can experiment with layering, textured fabrics, and horizontal lines to add volume. Fitted clothes can highlight your frame.
  - Curvy Build: Embrace your curves with tailored pieces, wrap dresses, and A-line skirts. V-necks and empire waists can be flattering. Avoid shapeless or overly tight clothing.
  - Athletic Build: Highlight your physique with fitted clothing. V-necks can soften broad shoulders. Experiment with different textures and patterns.
