# HTTPS Setup for Fashion AI Project Advisor

This application is configured to run with HTTPS support for secure development and production environments.

## üîí HTTPS Features

### Development Environment
- **Self-signed certificates**: Automatically generated using Next.js experimental HTTPS support
- **Secure local development**: All pages served over HTTPS at `https://localhost:3000`
- **Certificate management**: Certificates stored in `./certificates/` directory

### Security Headers
The application includes security headers for production:
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
- `Strict-Transport-Security` - Forces HTTPS connections

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Development with HTTPS (Default)
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts the development server at `https://localhost:3000`

### Development with HTTP (Alternative)
```bash
npm run dev:http
```
This starts the development server at `http://localhost:3000`

### Production with HTTPS
```bash
npm run build
npm run start:https
```

### Custom HTTPS Server
```bash
npm run start:custom
```
Uses the custom server.js with HTTPS configuration

## üì± Application URLs

Once running, access these Fashion AI features:

- **Main Dashboard**: `https://localhost:3000/project-advisor`

- **Outfit Builder**: `https://localhost:3000/project-advisor/outfit-builder`
- **Profile Manager**: `https://localhost:3000/project-advisor/profile`

## üõ°Ô∏è Certificate Information

### Development Certificates
- **Location**: `./certificates/`
- **Files**: 
  - `localhost.pem` (Certificate)
  - `localhost-key.pem` (Private Key)
- **Generated by**: Next.js mkcert integration
- **Validity**: Local development only

### Production Certificates
For production deployment, replace the development certificates with:
- Valid SSL certificates from a Certificate Authority (CA)
- Let's Encrypt certificates (free)
- Cloud provider certificates (AWS ACM, Cloudflare, etc.)

## üîß Configuration Files

### next.config.js
- HTTPS security headers
- Image optimization for HTTPS sources
- Webpack configuration for secure builds

### server.js
- Custom HTTPS server implementation
- Certificate loading and validation
- Error handling for HTTPS connections

## üåê Deployment Options

### Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
vercel --prod
```
Automatic HTTPS with Vercel's edge network

### Netlify
```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```
Automatic HTTPS with Netlify's CDN

### Docker with HTTPS
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm ci --only=production
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "start:custom"]
```

### Manual Server Setup
1. Obtain SSL certificates
2. Update `server.js` with certificate paths
3. Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
4. Set up automatic certificate renewal

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Certificate Warnings
- Browser may show security warnings for self-signed certificates
- Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed to localhost" to continue
- Add certificates to system trust store for seamless development

### Port Conflicts
- Change port in `server.js` if 3000 is occupied
- Update environment variables: `PORT=3001 npm run dev`

### Certificate Regeneration
```bash
# Remove existing certificates
rm -rf certificates/

# Restart development server to regenerate
npm run dev
```
