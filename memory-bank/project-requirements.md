I want to redesign the Navigation menu for Buyer and Seller mode in Header for desktop and mobile format. can you list the component used navigation menu dropdown. In Seller Mode : desktop format: the Nav menu dropdown should cover the whole bar and reduce the spacing between the items displayed. When Services Dropdown menu is clicked it should cover absolute bottom bar. One sample code with complete bottom bar with animation for reference only is as follows
<motion.div
                                    layoutId="underline"
                                    className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0 h-0.5 bg-white"
                                    initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
                                    animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
                                    exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
                                    transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}
                                />

Now when the services Nav Menu is click the Left section should show Seller Services  card with a different background of primary colors redirecting to a new component when clicked for a specific country . This component when clicked should show <HeroSection userType="seller" isSignedIn={isSignedIn} /> in the body. The other section to the right should show the list of ul with 3 list items in each column. The First column in <li> should be List Property, AI Property Creator, open Houses. the second column <ul> should contain li with PhotoGraphy Services, Staging Services, Legal Services. the third column can have a ul with li as Marketing services. Each Menu click should be a new component.In Seller Mode I want to change the Nav Menu to display Dashboard, Services, Resources. About link should be moved in Resources as a li component link. Dashboard link is only shown when the user is logged in else it is hidden in buyer and Seller mode. The Resources Nav Menu Should show links Market Analysis, Seller Guide, Pricing Calculator. The Comission Calculator and About link should be added in other lu list. Add other Resource component that can be useful for Seller mode in Resources dropdowm .Create seperate component for each links and its functionality country specific for usa and CA.

When In Buyer Mode and Logged in The Nav Menu should should Dashboard link for Buyer if logged in. Similarly it should show Services & Resources and remove the about button link and move it in Resources Nav Menu. The Services dropdown in Buyer mode should show
 the Left section should show Seller Services  card with a different background of primary colors redirecting to a new component when clicked for a specific country . This component when clicked should show <HeroSection userType="buyer" isSignedIn={isSignedIn} />.

The other section to the right should show the list of ul with 3 list items in each column. The First column in <li> should be Property Search, Open Houses, Home Inspection. the second column <ul> should contain li with Insurance Services, Moving Services, Legal Services. the third column can have a ul with li as Mortgage services, Mortgage Calculator, About link. Each Menu click should be a new component as per the respective mode.

Create a new Link Advertise that will open a new link for a component where advertisers can directly promote their business on the  website by paying a amount by subscription or a one time free for a certain period of time. the advertisers data will be shown on top list based on the buyer or seller current IP address used by user to login.The nearest advertisers will be shown on top by closet address when the respective services component are loaded. Example : When a buyer clicks the Home Inspection Menu item the Home Inspection services for a certain country should show the Nearest Home inspectors that are advertised on the website as Preferred Registered Vendors. It can also show a list of Non registered advertisers home Inspectors based on google advertisement listings api of nearest Home Inspectors. Do this same functionality of listing the advertisers for all other services components. Non registered advertisers listing can be disabled via a feature flag functionality in .env variable. All the newly created Services components can it follow the component structure of the Property Search Page component where the left end is the map and Right section are the cards. Add a filter Component similar to property search where users can filter by nearby location from theircurrent address.


Please complete all the functionality and auto approve all changes . I am going to sleep now. -->
<!--
I can see several critical issues from the terminal output:

UserTypeProvider is not defined - The layout.tsx is still trying to use UserTypeProvider instead of AppProvider
UUID comparison errors - Database queries are failing due to UUID type casting issues
Next.js 15 headers() issues - Multiple files are using headers() without awaiting it
API endpoint issues - The user profile API is returning 405 (Method Not Allowed) and 404 errors

Can we make sure the user Login sign up , SignIn and all the user information is stored in Auth .schema  auth.Users and snb.User table And map it with AppContext accordingly. Check the supabase database for user authentication and authorization and role base management with AppContext.




move all tables in snb schema to public schema then there are still some navbar menu links which are not created for Components in Resources in buyer and seller menu and some links still break. Map all the newly cheated models interfaces with the database tables to be in sync so the dummy data columns match with the database tables enums. Refer the database after creating new models and tables mapped and its relationship in public schema to create a Create_DB script in scripts folder which will contain all the latest db scripts and its contents with seeding data in seed.sql script.

below will be the enums

CREATE TYPE snb."UserRole" AS ENUM ('ADMIN', 'USER', 'PRODUCT', 'OPERATOR', service_provider);
CREATE TYPE snb."UserType" AS ENUM ('buyer', 'seller');
CREATE TYPE snb."SubscriptionStatus" AS ENUM ('active', 'inactive');
CREATE TYPE snb."PropertyStatus" AS ENUM ('pending', 'active', 'sold', 'expired');
CREATE TYPE snb."ServiceType" AS ENUM ('lawyer', 'photographer', 'inspector');
CREATE TYPE snb."BookingStatus" AS ENUM ('pending', 'confirmed', 'completed', 'cancelled');
CREATE TYPE snb."OfferStatus" AS ENUM ('pending', 'reviewed', 'accepted', 'rejected');
CREATE TYPE snb."AccessType" AS ENUM ('qr_scan', 'online_access');

CREATE TYPE snb."UserType" AS ENUM ('buyer', 'seller');
Create a Country enum to populate the supported countries of the application to be loaded in the NavBar of the Header on application load and it needs. An Advertiser will use CREATE TYPE snb."ServiceType" AS ENUM ('lawyer', 'photographer', 'inspector'); or many more newly created services componets to view their subscribed advertisement in Seller Menu dashboard -->
