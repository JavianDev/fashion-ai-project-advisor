# SonoBrokers Platform - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
SonoBrokers was created to disrupt the traditional real estate market by removing the need for realtor intermediaries, reducing commission fees, and simplifying the property buying and selling process. The platform empowers users to transact directly while still accessing essential professional services.

## Problems It Solves
- High realtor commission fees
- Lack of transparency in property transactions
- Complexity and inefficiency in the buying/selling process
- Limited access to on-demand professional services (legal, inspection, photography)

## How It Should Work
- Sellers and buyers register and verify their identities
- Sellers can list properties, upload images, and set prices
- Buyers can search, filter, and view listings, and contact sellers directly
- Integrated booking and payment for professional services (lawyers, photographers, inspectors)
- Secure, role-based access and document storage
- Real-time messaging and transaction management
- Analytics and support features for all users

## User Experience Goals
- Simple, intuitive onboarding and navigation
- Fast, responsive search and listing management
- Secure, transparent, and trustworthy transactions
- Seamless integration of professional services
- Mobile-friendly and accessible design
